        <h1> About me</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
        <P>My name is Ana Maria Popescu and I come from Galati, a city in Romania that borders Moldova and Ukraine. </p>
        <p>Growing up, I studied linguistics and humanities, but before graduating high school I decided to apply to ICT at Fontys.</p>
        <p>I am now a first year student here, specializing in Media Design. I hope that one day I can apply this knowledge to become either a teacher, or a UX designer.</p>
        <p>My hobbies are mostly related to stimulating my creativity and eye for arts and aestethics, which makes me think I am a good fit for my profile. I love music, films, (contemporary) art, linguistics, anthropology, trying out new cuisines, and traveling. I aspire to know a little bit about everything, and to use stick those bits together like pieces of a puzzle in order to create something unique, and beautiful.</p>

        <h1>About my team: Tableau de l’est</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
        <p>Our group for the project is called “Tableau de l’est”, which is French for “Painting of the East”, as all the members are originally from countries  that are East from the Netherlands, and because the project is centered about helping a Greek artist and engineer, Erion, display his artworks. </p>
        <p>We are motivated to manage to make Erion’s wishes come true when it comes to a website where he can show and sell his art, as well as let people interested in his work get in touch with him for custom pieces or purchases.</p>
        <p>You can see pictures of each team member on the right.</p>

    <h1>Portfolio inspiration</h1>
    <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
    <p>Last semester, my old portfolio (<a href="PEP2/index.html">click here to access it</a>) was clean and well organized, showcasing my activity, feedback and learning outcomes week by week. </p>
</p> This time, I want to do the same, but take it to a next level by adding more dynamism to how I display my work, from flexbox shapes to colors. </p>
<p> My color scheme inspiration is Diaries of a Dork, a series of colourful books of sketches I used to read as a child, as seen on the right.</p>
<p>The reason why I chose this as my inspiration is that during our first Media class this semester, Josh said to think of the portfolio as a journal of our work, and my mind went to this. </p>
<p>Initially I wanted my portfolio to even have a journal vibe and feel, but through UCD lessons I realized that would not be ideal.</p>
