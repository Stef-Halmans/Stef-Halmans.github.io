        <h3>How I reached this learning outcome</h3>
        <p>Throught the entire semester, I made sure to take the user's needs into account and to come up with iterations that I would improve based on research, interviews, and feedback. </p>

      <h3>Logo Iterations</h3>
      <p>I used multiple iterations and asked for feedback in order to achieve the ideal shape for my website's and photography portfolio's logos.</p>
      <h3>Photo book iterations</h3>
      <p>These logo iterations also helped shape the final results for my photography book. Everything can be observed in detail on the Media Production page.</p>

      <div class="rectangle-2">
        <h3>Videography</h3>
        <p>I was the person who wrote the script for the video we made for media prodcution, a story of a man who ended up homeless because he didn't have a pen at the right moment, which then shifts into a eleshopping-style ad for pens.</p>
        <p>My script, including not just what had to be said on camera, but also how people should act their emotions and our props has been changed after getting feedback from the team and the teachedr.</p>
        <p>We shortened the story to fit the 5 minute length criteria and got rid of some scenes that could be interpreted as too sad/ exaggerated.</p>

      <p>The text layout is changed so that the page looks more spacious, with a bigger image on the side. We also added a category where Erion's favorite pieces of art are displayed, which has a horizontal scroll option.</p>

        <h3>Work during the week</h3>
        <p>We designed the wireframe of Erion's website together, and I came up with the gallery page where the user can access a size enhanced version of a painting, its title and description.</p>
        <p>After everyone came up with their own version of a prototype, we decided to base it on the wireframe in the end.</p>
        <p>I helped design the high fidelity prototype, but my page was redesigned as a pop-up in the end.</p>

          <h3> Acting our scenarios out </h3> <br>
          <p> On Tuesday, each team was assigned to act and film the scenario of our user personas out in order to showcase if they are realistic. </p> <Br>
          <h3> Feedback on text align </h3> <br> 
        <p> I got some contradictory feedback from my Media and Developement teachers regarding the text align function, one of them saying to align text on the left, and one by using justify. Ultimately, I will compare the two separate ideas with examples from professionals before making a decision for my portfolio.</p>
         <br> 
         <h3> Progress on PEP developement and UCD </h3> <br>
         <p> I decided to add a "Jump to the top" button to my website, so that the user wouldn't have to scroll all the way up. I think this is good UCD practice as well as for Developement, since I am gaining more Javascript experience through it.</p>

            <p> Our team came up with a MoSCoW prioritization list in order to define what our project Must have, Should have, Could have, and Will Not have, as seen on the left. </p>

            <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
            <p> After the MoSCoW list, we came up with a prototyping plan for our website map, wireframe, paper prototype, and in the end, Figma prototype, with guidance from our teacher. </p>
            <p> We know that the prototype is the final deliverable for the UCD subject and want to take it slowly by brainstorming the best ways to build our website in the following weeks. </p>

              <h3> Manifesto </h3> <br>
              <p> I came up with the manifesto “We paint the future” that aims to systematically answer the questions: Who? What? For whom? </p> <br>
              <p> We, as the team Tableau de l’Est, work together to “paint” a website for the artist and engineer Erion, so he can display his artwork to those interested and find clients for his works and commissions.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>The vision statement</h3><br>
              <p> Our team came up with a vision statement document where we describe the goals and objects of the artist website, define the target audience, identify the unique product proposition, user experience, and craft the statement. </p>
              <br>
              <p> Our statement is: “Our goal is to create an artist website that showcases the artist's unique style and creative process, while also providing a platform for art enthusiasts and potential fans to connect with the artist. <br>  We aim to provide a platform that allows visitors to immerse themselves in the artist's unique style ,explore the artist's portfolio, read about his background and inspiration,  connect with the artist on a personal level. Our focus is on creating a website that reflects the artist's creativity and story, while also being responsive and accessible on all devices.  ”</p>

              <p>  We got positive feedback, but we got recommended to replace the user scenario that we already had with a user persona description, and create a longer, more in-depth scenario. </p>

              </p> <br>
              <p> I have already started taking UCD more into consideration by respecting the feedback received by my media teacher, changing my logo to a simpler one with only two colors (iterations were available), as well as change my four-column layout into a two-column one. I want to make my website  more aestethically pleasing and easier to navigate. </p>

            <br>
            <p>I was grouped with Artun and we got a total of 8 responses from various types of people, including a French woman who is passionated by films and goes to the Cannes festival, as well as a woman working/ contributing at the Plastic Museum in Bruxelles. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In order to be able to come up with the best version of a website for our stakeholder, we have to carry out user reseaarch, analyze it, and see what the results of processing that information is. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Our team will go over the answers received and come up with suitable ideas and solutions to start prototyping Erion's art display website. </p>

<h1>About UCD</h1>
<p>We use User Centered Design to cater for a user who keeps evolving and to provide something useful and easy to use for them, based on psychology and anthropological studies.</p>
<p>Usability makes things go faster and minimzes processing expenses, as well as collects data faster in relation to how often a website is used, generating revenue.</p>
<p>On the right you can see my answer to the question "How do you see yourself as a UX designer in the future?"

</p>
<p>The role of a UX designer always changes and improves. </p>
<p>In the virtual world it's important to use a language that meets the user's requirements in language and accesibility, while in the ohysical world it's not so easy switching from business to business or shop to shop and you are inclined to prefer to ask someone for more information instead of "skipping". Of course, UCD laws can be broken in our advantage.</p>
<h1>Good and bad</h1>
<p>As an exercise, we had to showcase good and bad websites. These examples are one of each category, that I found:</p>
<p>GOOD: <a href="https://www.glossier.com/">Glossier</a> - matches brand identity, easy to navigate, very good pictures, promo at the top of the page, all buttons are intuitive</p>
<p>BAD: <a href="https://www.farmaciilemyosotis.ro/">Myosotis Pharmacies (Romanian)</a> - boxy, the “news” list is too big and you have to scroll to access the information, incomplete page "medicamente" where you should find information about medicine, the background and padding don't make sense.</p>

<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<h3>(for a fruit distribution company, in my case)</h3>
<p>WHAT YOU DO  - We deliver fruit across the world.</p>
<p>HOW YOU DO IT – Ethically, responsibly,and fast, while protecting the planet </p>
<p>WHY YOU DO IT – to provide for people across the world</p>


<h1>Empathy map</h1>
<p>The group assignment was to create an empathy map for our project, and we started doing it regarding attendance in our group. </p>
<img src="images/empathymap.jpg">
<p>with our coach we came up with a green-yellow-red card system for when we miss classes without a good enough explanation or without letting the rest of the team know in proper time.</p>
<p>Later, we also created an empathy map for our stakeholder based on our interview with him.</p>

<h1> Feedback </h1>
<p> All the feedback I and my team have received so far was good, except for the team's rocky start when there was a disagreement at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<h1> Learning outcomes</h1>
<p>"You create prototypes of interactive media products for your client by using iterations, user research and examples from the professional field."</p>
<p>My team has started the iterative process for Erion's website, based on the interviews we had with him and analyzing the results of user interviews and surveys in order to achieve what is best for a website where our stakeholder can display his artwork.</p>
<img src="images/logoiteration02.jpg">
<p>Furthermore, in order to perfect my portfolio, I have started paper prototyping to get a feel of how I want my website to look and feel like. I have ran surveys around my classmates to choose and give me feedback between a "journal feel" and a modern look and chose to go with the latter (still in the works) as it was the user's favorite.</p>
