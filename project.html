    <h3> Feedback received </h3>
    <p> After my portfolio submission, this was the feedback received:</p>
    <p>"Always present and active in all the group activities.</p>
    <P>Very nice reflection on the work done so far.</P>
    <p>Given the group dynamics,would be nice to reflect also on your efforts to bridge the gaps in the group."</p>

      <h3>Reflection on our teamwork</h3>
      <p>Although the conflict in our group has been silently forgotten about, it is very hard to work with our group. There is a separation between the friend group in the team and the rest of us, which causes a big lack of written communication and delays in our work, as tasks are only distributed when certain members are present, despite our protest against it.</p>
      <p>Members in our team come hours later then they announce they will, which means some of us are waiting for them for the bigger part of the day.</p>
      <p>Another problem we have is a member who is taking everything personally and is not behaving profesionally. She has been using aggressive language (curse words), has openly expressed feelings of homophobia and tried to convince us of her religious beliefs, and who has also been refusing to give more complex tasks to a part of the group, based on her "feeling" that we would be unable to do it.</p>
      <p>There have been instances where the said member has not been doing her part of the work on time which influenced how late work done by other members has been done.</p>
      <p>Despite all of these dificulties, our team is alltogether trying to behave professionally when it comes to putting in the required work. Direct aggressions against Artun have stopped. There currently is nothing to mediate as all of us are aware that our most important goal is not being friends with each other, but finishing the project on time and making sure we do it well. This is something I appreciate in my team a lot and cannot complain about at all.</p>

      <h3> Research document </h3> <br> 
      <P> During this week, we kept working on our research document in order to polish it up. I contributed with the second part of it, where we talk about our stakeholder, Erion. I described him in detail, as well as his wishes for the website we will be creating for him. </P>
     <br> <h3> Team meeting </h3> <br>
      <p> We had a team meeting to go over our progress and put it in our git ReadMe file as well. </p>

    <h3> Our manifesto </h3> <br> 
    <p>I came up with the manifesto “We paint the future” that aims to systematically answer the questions: Who? What? For whom? </p> <br>
      <p>We, as the team Tableau de l’Est, work together to “paint” a website for the artist and engineer Erion, so he can display his artwork to those interested and find clients for his works and commissions. 
      </p> <br>

      <h3> Other group deliverables </h3> <br>
      <p> Our team also came up with a MoSCoW list and a project statement to help define our goals and needs for the seemster assignment.  </p>

    <h3> Progress presentation </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Our team built a presentation of our progress and progress on user personas, based on the survey and interviews that we carried out. For the user persona pictures, we used thispersondoesnotexist.com, and our personas are based on survey and interview responses. </p> <br> 
    <p>  We got positive feedback, but we got recommended to replace the user scenario that we already had with a user persona description, and create a longer, more in-depth scenario. </p>
    <p> We were told to get in touch with Erion and share our progress with him so that he could get updated on our findings. </p>
    <p> Initially, we couldn't access our presentation because of a practical issue, but my teammates and I managed to come up with a new presentation and we got congratulated on that and on our skills. </p>

   <h3> First feedback on PEP </h3><br>
   <p> I received positive feedback on my portfolio submission and was told to add links to the project deliverables and GIT. </p><br>
   <p> Project progress </p> <br> 
   <p>We worked on the research document as a group then worked on the results sections individually, and I was assigned to come up with a user manifesto over the weekend. </p>

    <h3>Carrying out surveys and interviews </h3>
            <br> 
            <p>We divided in smaller groups and decided to go out in the world to carry out surveys with people who might be interested in art. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I was grouped with Artun and we got a total of 8 responses from various types of people, including a French woman who is passionated by films and goes to the Cannes festival, as well as a woman working/ contributing at the Plastic Museum in Bruxelles. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our group also carried out interviews with people from the world of art, such as an art gallery owner. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="rectangle-2">
   <h3> Team planning </h3> <br> 
   <p>We went over our progress and came up with a plan of what to do next in terms of our surveys, analyzing them, carrying out interviews with people who are interested in art, as well as building user personas for everyone.</p>

        <h1>About Project Erion </h1>
        <p>This semester we met Erion, a Greek artist and engineer who our teams of students will work for.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to create a website that displays his artwork for people interested in seeing it, buying it, as well as contacting Erion for inquiries and custom artpieces.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this, our team works together to combine Erion's wishes with what would be best for his website according to user research, using what the subjects we have teach us: Media Production, User-Centered Design, and Developement classes.</p>

        <h1>About our team: Tableau de l'est</h1>
        <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
        <p>Our group for the project is called “Tableau de l’est”, which is French for “Painting of the East”, as all the members are originally from countries  that are East from the Netherlands, and because the project is centered about helping a Greek artist and engineer, Erion, display his artworks. </p>
        <p>We are motivated to manage to make Erion’s wishes come true when it comes to a website where he can show and sell his art, as well as let people interested in his work get in touch with him for custom pieces or purchases.</p>
        <p>You can see pictures of each team member on the right.</p>

            <h1>Progress and what I did</h1>
            <p>Using DOT framework and aiming to prioritize the consumer needs, our team started by gathering questions for an interview with Erion, then managed to come up with a survey and an interview to be conducted for potential users, whose results will be combined with the stakeholder's empathy map in order to achieve and facilitate a result that is up to expectations.</p>
            <p>We regularly conduct team meetings to be on board with what we have to do and manage to use each of the team member's best abilities to work together for a satisfying results.</p>
            <p>To help my team make progress on the project, I helped come up with interview questions for our stakeholder, survey and interview questions for users, and helped distribute the questions. I attend group meetings and contribute to teamwork.</p>

            <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
            <p>Here is how I believe I have achieved the following learning outcomes:</p>
            <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
            <p>Research: performed a detailed analysis on the best ways to build Erion's website based on the interview we had with him as the stakeholder, interviews and surveys with potential users.</p>
            <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
            <p>Communication: so far, an interview was carried on in order to discuss the stakeholder's wishes and what can be done based on that. We will have a follow-up interview where we communicate what can be done to satisfy him. </p>
            <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
            <p>Professional identity: I built this portfolio, that reflects my growth as a student since the start of the semester, as well as motivation of my choices. You can find more about it on the homepage.</p>
