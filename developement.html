      <p>Proofs of concepts: focusing on small bits of coding while aiming for fundamental skills in JavaScript by the end of the semester.</p>
      <p>Validated requirements: I base my code on interviews with my stakeholders and users, as well as feedback from teachers and users.</p>
      <p>Version control tools: I use Git in my group project to share progress between each other, and will start using it for my portfolio and front-end assignments as well.</p>

        <h3> Feedback </h3>
        <p> I asked for feedback regarding the direction of my portfolio progress and it was positive, emphasizing on the idea of the student being able to showcase a collection of diverse, different skills related to developement. </p> <br>
        <p> Moreover, I got some contradictory feedback from my Media and Developement teachers regarding the text align function, one of them saying to align text on the left, and one by using justify. Ultimately, I will compare the two separate ideas with examples from professionals before making a decision for my portfolio. </p>

      <div class="rectangle-2"><h3> Jump to top button </h3>
        <h3> Progress on PEP developement and UCD </h3>
         <p> I decided to add a "Jump to the top" button to my website, so that the user wouldn't have to scroll all the way up. I think this is good UCD practice as well as for Developement, since I am gaining more Javascript experience through it.</p>

        <h3> Javascript </h3>
        <p> We were introduced to Javascript and were assigned to firstly display a list of our teammate's names and then pictures. Afterwards, we were challenged to use an API to display live data such as the current weather, which I chose to do too, for the weather in Eindhoven. 

        
        </p> <br> 
        <p> You can access the results of my work by clicking <a href="classmates/"> here</a>. </p> <br> 
        <p> The result is not very aestethic as I currently already have a part about my team on my profile and I focused on the theoretical aspect and showing that I can code it. </p>

        <h3> Feedback on PEP</h3> <br> 
        <p>As of right now, the feedback received on my portfolio for developement is not available, due to my link not having been noticed. I am working on making the teacher aware of the link's presence on Canvas. </p> <br>
        <h3> Reflection</h3>
        <p>To make my website a better display of my skills, I have reflected and decided which things I would like to add to future iterations.</p>
        <br> <p>  I would add a parallax effect that appears when accessing my home page, that displays my logo. Moreover, I want to use Javascript in order to add a “Jump back to top” button when scrolling, as well as a way to divide each weeks’ process similarly to last semester’s portfolio </p>

    <p>We were assigned to recreate the website of the <a href="aircompany.com">Air Company</a></p>
    <p>As seen on the right, except for the fonts and logo that couldn't be replicated, I managed to complete this assignment, adding a video background and margin on the top.</p>
    <p>What I didn't do right was adding a lot of & nsbp because I am not yet skilled enough to use margins, but I will perfect that in time for the next portfolio submission.</p></div>

    <h1>Feedback received on my portfolio</h1>
    <p>On Wednesday, 22.03.2023, I presented my portfolio to Frank with some questions. He looked through my code and advised me to start using margins instead of & nsbp to cdreate space, as this is not an effective way to build my website. </p>
    <p>I will better my website by the time of the next deadline, and perfect this skill by working on more assignments from him.</p>
