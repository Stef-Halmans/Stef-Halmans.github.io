    </div>
      <p>Last time I asked for feedback on my portfolio and possible future grading, I got reccommended to change the layout of my development page to just one type, add more coding experiments and showcase my use of Git. Also, I changed the word "developement" to its correct form without a third letter "E", "development".</p>
      <p>After doing all that was recommended to me, the feedback received on 31.05.2023 was positive and I got told it would be nice to use more padding, align text to the left and use more images, as well as keep doing what I am doing. I told Frank that I am going to add snapscroll to the development page sections and he said it is a good thing to add what I have learned through my coding experiments to my "more serious" projects as well. </p>

        <p> Click on the title to access my portfolio's Git repository. </p>
        <p> After receiving feedback to show how I use Git, I added my portfolio to Git and started pushing and pulling between two laptops through which I edit my code. </p>
        <p> GitLab is also used in my <a href="https://git.fhict.nl/I476896/s2023_m2_cb01_group2_tableau_de_lest"> group project</a>, especially as we will start coding soon, but so far we update our readme file together every week with what activity has been done by each person n the group and then we commit it. </p>

      <h1><a href="snapscroll/index.html">Scroll snap</a></h1>
      <p>We were asked by Frank to try an exercise such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytl6TrroGis&t=265s">Scroll snap</a> for our portfolio. It was not the easiest assignment as I initially thouht it was only working on mobile browsers and the youtuber was not showing all of his code to the viewers, but after a bit of exploring I managed to do it and I am thnking of implementing it in this portfolio page's sections as well. </p>

      <p>For this exercise I created a JavaScript colliding animation with two different speeds for elements in the colors of my webpage to try out if I understand what I learned. </p>
      <p>I really enjoyed this assignment and I would like to try out more animation experiments in the future. </p>

        <p>Click on the title to access my to-do list.</p>
        <p>Using W3Schools to learn, I made a to-do list where you can add your own elements, mark them off as done, delete them and even drag them across the page to change their order. </p>
        <p>I learned a lot through this assignment, most interestingly how to drag and drop elements, which was a bit "extra" to the assignment given. </p>

        <h1> Feedback </h1>
        <p> I asked for feedback regarding the direction of my portfolio progress and it was positive, emphasizing on the idea of the student being able to showcase a collection of diverse, different skills related to developement. </p> <br>
        <p> Moreover, I got some contradictory feedback from my Media and Developement teachers regarding the text align function, one of them saying to align text on the left, and one by using justify. Ultimately, I will compare the two separate ideas with examples from professionals before making a decision for my portfolio. </p>

        <h1> Jump to top button </h1>
        <h3> Progress on PEP developement and UCD </h3>
         <p> I decided to add a "Jump to the top" button to my website, so that the user wouldn't have to scroll all the way up. I think this is good UCD practice as well as for Developement, since I am gaining more Javascript experience through it.</p>

        <p> We were introduced to Javascript and were assigned to firstly display a list of our teammate's names and then pictures. Afterwards, we were challenged to use an API to display live data such as the current weather, which I chose to do too, for the weather in Eindhoven. 

        
        </p> <br> 
        <p> You can access the results of my work by clicking <a href="classmates/"> here</a> or on the title . </p> <br> 
        <p> The result is not very aestethic as I currently already have a part about my team on my profile and I focused on the theoretical aspect and showing that I can code it. </p>

        <h1> Feedback on PEP</h1> <br> 
        <p>As of right now, the feedback received on my portfolio for developement is not available, due to my link not having been noticed. I am working on making the teacher aware of the link's presence on Canvas. </p> <br>
        <h1> Reflection</h1>
        <p>To make my website a better display of my skills, I have reflected and decided which things I would like to add to future iterations.</p>
        <br> <p>  I would add a parallax effect that appears when accessing my home page, that displays my logo. Moreover, I want to use Javascript in order to add a “Jump back to top” button when scrolling, as well as a way to divide each weeks’ process similarly to last semester’s portfolio </p>

    <p>We were assigned to recreate the website of the <a href="aircompany.com">Air Company</a></p>
    <p>If you click on the title you will see that, except for the fonts and logo that couldn't be replicated, I managed to complete this assignment, adding a video background and margin on the top.</p>
    <p>What I didn't do right was adding a lot of & nsbp because I am not yet skilled enough to use margins, but I will perfect that in time for the next portfolio submission.</p></div>

      <h1> Feedback received on my portfolio</h1>
      <p>On Wednesday, 22.03.2023, I presented my portfolio to Frank with some questions. He looked through my code and advised me to start using margins instead of & nsbp to cdreate space, as this is not an effective way to build my website. </p>
    <p>I will better my website by the time of the next deadline, and perfect this skill by working on more assignments from him.</p>

      <p>"You program and integrate proofs of concepts based on validated requirements and documented with version control tools."</p>
    <p>Proofs of concepts: focusing on small bits of coding while aiming for fundamental skills in JavaScript by the end of the semester.</p>
    <p>Validated requirements: I base my code on interviews with my stakeholders and users, as well as feedback from teachers and users.</p>
    <p>Version control tools: I use Git in my group project to share progress between each other, and will start using it for my portfolio and front-end assignments as well.</p>
