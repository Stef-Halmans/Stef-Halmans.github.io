            <p> During week 18, I coordinated the presentation work. We made a draft document where we detailed the structure of it and details of each slide. </p>
            <p> I came up with the layout of the introductory slides, the ending, and the structure of our demonstration and how to word things we were going to present, coming with and receiving feedback between my teammates and I.</p>
            <p> I reviewed some parts for English mistakes/ better phrasing and then we rehearsed our presentation three times, on Zoom and then physically.</p>
            <p> Lastly, we decided to coordinate outfit colors (dark blue jeans, black top) to look more put together. </p>

            <p> On Monday, Dennis helped me solve an error I was encountring with linking anchors of other websites, and I have also followed his advice to quote the sources of my JavaScript buttons that I have gotten from the internet. Those links are cited in the comments of my .js code </p>
            
            <p> My teammate, Alexandra, asked me to help her with her PEP's layout and to review the information she included. We spent some time together on the flexbox and grid of her website, the font size and spacing, as well as the padding on the website. </p>

                <li>search bar to sort through conversations</li>

            <p> I have helped merge the CSS files with my teams, there were a few details we had to look over since we had some issues with different header settings between each other. The black border between the header and the rest of the page used to go on top of the menu on the top right side when opening it. Solving that took a while, but we managed to do it, as seen in the picture. </p>

            <h3>PEP </h3>
            <p>After receiving feedback on my portfolio submission from week 15, I have made the following changes to my PEP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> structuring my website following the figma prototype</li>
                <li> I restructured my website's layout in two wider grips instead of 4, adding padding on the sides for a cleaner look.</li>
                <li> I decided to use less text, and arrange it in lists for it to be more organized.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>Furthermore, I have created hyperlink anchors between pages by week (starting with this week), so that when you click on the word "here" found in the subheader of each week, you will be taken from (eg.) Week's 16 work section to Week's 16 feedback section and vice-versa. </p>

                <h3>Chat function background</h3>
                <p>After talking to Corrie about my options, I performed more user research by asking for opinions about the ideal background color for my open chat window. In the end, it seemed that the most common response was that
                    <span class="ccolor">ECF5F5</span>
                    was the best option. </p>

            <p> During this week, I have worked on structuring my website after the Figma prototype (see picture below). I am aware that the prototype is not a complete version so I want to make changes and add more elements, such as time stamps, but this is the first outline. </p>

                <p> I aimed to make my PEP an image-based way of storytelling, with sparks of dynamism, such as GIFs, music, and splashes of color (pictures of my team, our progress, feedback) inside of a mostly black-and-grey choice of aestethic.</p>
                <p> I added buttons using JavaScript to create a "back to the top" option that appears on the user's screen as they scroll far enough down from the top, as well as a menu panel in the upper left corner, that can send the user to one of the pages: Homepage - introduction about myself, my team, and my portfolio concept; Feedback; My work (the page we are on right now); Contact. <br>
                I also added hyperlinks at the top of the "My work" and "Feedback" pages so the use can jump directly to the weeks' feed that they are interested in. <br>
                Then, I added an embedded playlist, an embedded map for the university campus, and contact buttons that, when clicked, go directly to mail, phone or WhatsApp to start a call or a chat.</p>

              <p>  During our technical skills day, we were asked to use flexbox in order to create an image grid similar to Imgur or Pinterest. I enjoyed this assignment so much that when I got home, I tried to play around with it and used it as a shape for a little journal for my past experiences, feelings, and pictures. </p>
              <p> I realized that I like this so much that I want to modify my PEP around this idea, which is the story behind my current version of it. I rounded the corners of my pictures to style them a little, added music which I believe is a nice touch to make this more personal, and found a color scheme and fonts to stick with. I know I used grey as a background which is not indicated, but this is the style I am aiming for with this, and I hope it will be okay. </p>

                <p> We started trancribing our prototype from paper to Figma, and I got assigned the chat function. Initially, this was my version of it: </p>
                <img src="img/f117.jpg">
                <p> The girls suggested that the chat should have more rounded edges as this looks more like a skeleton, and that we should add a background. We are still working on the background because of trying to find one that doesn't mess with the color scheme and contrast of the website, but this could be another version for the chat page:</p>

               <p>Then, as a group assignment, we had to build a <em> working</em> website for a cat adoption website. <br>
               My team and I divded tasks then looked for sources of inspiration on the internet, and tried to follow those. <br> We have found that connecting pages together, and even using the same images on different pages can be very difficult in terms of resizing. We also struggled with creating singular footers and headers to use for each page, but I think that helped us realize eventual problems that might arise just in time for when we start building the housing website, as we will all work on having the same CSS page. </p>

                <p> we tried to finish everything in time for the submission deadline, but eventually realized we had a bigger problem: Git.</p>

                <p> Even though reccommended, neither of us had used git before in our team or the previous ones that were formed during the orienting semester. We all used other platforms such as WhatsApp in order to communicate on our progress in real time and indicate colors, fonts, etc. to be used by the whole team.  <br>
                Two of us didn't have it installed, which took a while to figure out because of the lengthy set up process. </p>
                <p> After everyone had git, we needed the help of teachers because the only computer it was properly working on was Anna's MacBook, which had a different system, so we couldn't follow her steps. </p>
                <p> In the end, we managed to push our work to git together before the deadline. We learned a valuable lesson: to stop delaying tasks we were told to get on track with. </p>

I couldn't replace the star and I got quite far behind by the end of the day because I didn't have enough experience to be able to finish this in time.

               <p> During week 10, we were introduced to the new project that we had to work on. We divided into teams of 3 and 4 people, and established a document on the rules and ethics of what working with each other will mean to us on a team level. <br> 
               Regarding our project, we brainstormed and reached an agreement on what we want to build: a website for international students to find accommodation more easily in the Netherlands. We came up with a problem definition document as well. </p>
               <p> I feel hopeful about how our work as a team will go, because the girls seem very friendly and we seem to complete each other in areas one might now about while the other not. </p>

                <p>On Friday, we learned about Gestalt and divided into different teams to try and exemplify different cases of it ourselves. I worked together with 4 other classmates and we decided to draw a sketch of a pair of headphones, with the gap inside it having the shape and look of a tree's outline. </p>
                <p>We had to present this in front of the cass, and my team chose me to do this. I would say that the presentation went a little rocky, because I felt very anxious as I didn't know my teachers or any of my classmates well enough. <br>
                According to feedback, it was a little complicated for our classmates to understand that there was a tree shape inside of the headphones, but we did our best to come up with something original for this assignment. </p>
