        <h3> Feedback from teachers on our project + presentation </h3>

        <p> We received very positive feedback on our presentation. </p>
        <p> To begin with, the teachers noticed that our outfits were coordinated, we were all wearing dark-blue jeans and black tops, and they appreciated that and told us it looked professional.</p>
        <p> Penny said that our presentation was "very good" and the information from the presentation was complete, so there were no questions from teachers.</p>
        <p> We received good feedback on our presentation design - especially how we showed our paper prototypes through a dynamic video, our team and how it worked together, how we presented, as well as on the website's design. </p>
        <p> About the website, it was especially noted that the prices displayed were pretty good estimates (ranging from low to high based on real student experience), as well as that all costs were noted and displayed while many real-life real estate agencies have hidden costs.</p>
        <p> Our user research and personas were diverse and we performed in-depth studies on the data received from the survey and interviews, and it was noted that we conducted even more user research on the UX of our website while working on it.</p>

            <h3>Learning outcomes:<strong> technical skills</strong> </h3>
            <p> I have proven my ability of developing and implementing an iterative process into my work as a student, as it follows:</p>
            <ul> 
            <li><strong>Trends and developments:</strong>  documented my progress and evolution as a Media Design student through this portofolio. </li>
            <li><strong> Iterative process: </strong> proven action taken based off feedback from teachers, teammates and users on my PEP and group project. </li>
            <li><strong> Interactive prototypes:</strong> my chat function is relevant to the user needs and developed through paper and Figma prototypes. It is coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  </li>
            <li> <strong>Target group: </strong> while developing the chat function webpage, the user's needs (timestamped messages and conversations, searchbar for the sidebar chat) and opinions (requested feedback on the best option for the open chat window and went with the most preferred option) were taken into account</li>

            <p>  I display professional behaviour in the areas of future-oriented organisation, investigative problem solving,
                personal leadership, and targeted interaction, as it follows:
            </p>

            <div class="cola cuteframe col-1">
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Future-oriented organisation:</strong>  with my team members, we created a planning of timing and sharing tasks between each other for our group project. We created shared documents where we made notes and agreements about the expected quality of our work. I took my teammates' work into account when needed and always asked for feedback.  </li>
              <li><strong> Investigative problem solving:</strong> we created a Moscow plan for our project, we came up with the adequate questions for the surveys and interviews conducted, and analyzed the results accordingly in order to come up with a good user study. From there, we developed user personas and worked to cater for their needs. </li>
             </ul>

            <div class="colb cuteframe col-2">
            <ul> 
                <li><strong>Personal leadership: </strong> I am motivated to bring my work to its goal, and take responsability for what could go wrong, working harder to meet my goal when needed. When I received negative feedback on my first portfolio submission, I worked harder to recover and get to level 2 of my technical skills. I seized the opportunity to grow by choosing specific tasks for myself, such as taking the interviews, coming up with the presentation design and ideas, and taking on the chat function webpage task, which was not easy (but helped me evolve as a student). During the semester, I stayed open to feedback, listened to it, reflected on it and applied it to my work. </li>
                <li> <strong>Targeted interaction:  </strong> I made sure to take the user's needs into account with my project. I respected my own roles within my team and gave relevant feedback to my teammates and classmates. </li>

            <p> He agreed that I made a lot of progress and he told me to quote the sources for the Java code used for the buttons (you can find them as comments in the .js code). </p>
            <p> He also reminded me to add a reflection on the learning outcomes I have met. </p>

            <p> We presented Roopali the progress we have made with our project, and explained her that the website is not finished yet and that even then, it will not be fully functional due to required back-end coding that makes the features work (referring to chat function, filters). </p>
            <p> We were told that that is not a problem and received the following feedback:</p> 
            <ul> 
                <li>The JavaScript button from the top right side that opens and collapses with options for the logged in user (such as Settings, Log Out) was a good idea.</li>
                <li>Anna has to include some more specific suggestive words for the user inside the search bar, so that it could be more understanbale. For example, instead of "Write something here...", we could suggest "Search for an address/ postcode".</li>
                <li>We have to make sure that we use the same CSS, especially for common elements such as our header.</li>

            <h3>Feedback on group project</h3>
            <p>During this week, I had a conversation with my study coach, Corrie, about my progress on the group project. I am working on the chat feature, so I asked for advice regarding a possible background for my chat windows. </p>
            <p>I showed her my options and explained why none of them is ideal (contrast, texture, respecting the color scheme of our project) and she suggested that I could run a user test and ask people for opinions on what would suit my website best.</p>

            <p> Today (<em>14.12.2022</em>) I had a conversation with Corrie (my StudyCoach). <br>
                We first talked about my personal situation (I had a personal problem + I have recently moved to a new room)<br>
                Then, I presented her my portfolio in its current form, and explained my vision with it and how things should work. She told me that I have improved and reminded me to add a reflection on the learning outcomes. <br>
                We also talked about my group project, team, and how it is going; if we talked about dividing tasks to start coding from home. I showed her our designing progress from Figma and asked her what I could do about the background of the chat feature that I am working on (it is hard to find something appropiate for our chosen colors and contrast), and she came with two ideas: a dotted background, and to ask the users what they would prefer between a white background and something else.</p>

            <p> This is how my team's Feedpulse looks like at the moment. </p>
            <p> Each of us believes that we are collaborating well at the moment, although lately (since the presentation) we have been more focused on individual work on our PEPs. <br>
            Most of my group is going to leave to go home for the holidays at the end of this week so it's time for us to divide tasks between each other. </p>

           <h3> Self-reflective feedback </h3>
           <p> I believe that compared to my initial PEP version that I turned in (see example picture below), this version manages to showcase my evolution as a student. </p>
           <img src="img/w4.jpg">
           <p> My initial form of the PEP seemed to have too many pages, which is what distracted me and overwhelmed me a lot, because at some point I got lost into it, even though I had a Figma and paper prototype. Furthermore, the Figma prototype seemed to have looked way better like that compared to my finalized website, which is why I decided to start from scratch with the aestethic of the it. </p>
           <p>I have improved my HTML and CSS skills, using less internal CSS and working on the overall style of my portoflio by having managed to find out how I want to shape it, and why. <br> 
            I got inspired by <a href="https://www.stedelijk.nl/nl/persbeeld/anne-imhof">Anne Imhof's Stedelijk Museum Expo's: <em>YOUTH</em> and <em>AI WINTER</em></a>, which I visited earlier this year and I resonated with the artists' point of view when transcribing youth through communist blocks and low saturated tones with unexpected violent splashes of color and sound/ movements. <br>
            This is why I decided to try and achieve the same while "storytelling" my experience of growth as a student. </p> 
            <p> As for the layout of my website, I was inspired by our Technical skills assignment from December 5, when we had to create an Imgur inspired image grid. <br>
            I enjoyed working on that and got positive feedback on it. I liked it so much that I tried to build a website around it by myself at home later that day, and that's when it all clicked and I realized I want my portfolio to be image based like this as well. </p>

                You show iterations in the work process and you explain how feedback from users and experts has contributed to your design choices. Your design meets the needs of the end user and is aesthetically justified."</em></p>
               <p> I believe that in the past weeks, I have been able to argue around how my new PEP version is shaped around and with the help of feedback received from my teachers. </p>

               <p> <em> "Target group <br>
                During the developmental process you take the interests and needs of the end user into account." </em></p>

            I am further accentuating my willingness to get better at my work by taking the initiative to learn new things, as well as dive deeper into what I already know.  <br>

           <p> Regarding the grading received for my work, I was disappointed in myself for not advancing in the ICT and Media Design technical skills, but I think I deserved my grade. <br>
            At first, I was very demotivated, as coming from my own school system in Romania, this seemed like a very bad mistake. <br>
            But after reflecting on it for a while, I realized this is not the end of my university experience and I am not failing, so I found the motivation to start working on my PEP from scratch. <br>
            I went to the TU/E library and focused on studying there whenever time would allow me, and researched answers for all my questions in order to improve and  be able to build the portfolio as it is right now. </p>
            <p> I realized I should be kinder to myself and give myself time to learn, because before coming to university here I have never coded anything, and a lot of concepts can still feel strange to me, besides completely new. </p>

               <p> I kept asking myself and my team questions about how we can find the best way to approach the way we want to proceed about both the website concept and how we want to start working on it. </p>

            <h3> Feedback from teachers</h3>
            <p> I had a conversation with Corrie (my StudyCoach) about why I had to miss some days of classes, and why I will have to miss more in the future, as a relative of mine died unexpectedly and I had to return back to Romania. </p>
            <p> We talked about my learning process with ADHD and discussed why the HERA server couldn't be hosted until we found the way to solve it (the assignment will be submitted late). I asked for feedback on the contrast of the colors I used for my PEP and she advised me to ask Penny for feedback, and showed me that I can use the ''inspect'' feature on webpages to check their padding etc. settings.</p>

            <p> I had to miss classes during most of this week due to personal circumastances, so me and my team had to collaborate online. I haven't received negative feedback on it, and my teammates were still pleased with my work. I did my best to fill in with my part of the task when I had to.</p>

            <p> There wasn't a lot of Feedback during this week, as we were still in the phase where with the newly gathered team, we had to get to know each other and come up with a plan to make things work between each other. <br>

           <h3> Self-reflective feedback </h3>
           <p> To give myself Feedback on my own portoflio as it is right now, I want to find a way to properly space out columns of text between each other and maybe insert a third column in certain sections of my pages. For the pages that don't have text divded into columns (like this one, as of right now), I want to find a way to style the page and the cateogries differently, so that an user reading my page will not have difficulties with it. <br>
           I would like to align my navigation bar differently and maybe underline hyperlinks to make it understandable that that is what they are. I am debating wheter or not I should add more elements to the bar, as in my PEP webpage  I have hyperlinks to multiple other pages that cannot be accessed through anywhere else. </p>

                 <p> I believe that this is a skill that I will be continuously working on during this semester, by adapting the shape of the project and my portfolio based on feedback, requirements, and the end goal: the ease with which the user will access these.</p>

            <p>The teachers have looked at our progress on the initial version of the PEPs that have to be turned in at the end of week 11, and opened a checkpoint for each member of the team. This is what I wrote:</p>
            <p><em>"Our teacher checked in on our progress with the PEP's and suggested free platforms for images, illustrations and icons, as well as Adobe colors for creating our own color schemes based on images we see and like."</em></p>

               This is a little daunting, but I hope that with time I can get to their level, as it is motivating to have skilled people around me. </p>
