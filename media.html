      <h3>The team and the task</h3>
      <p>Our team is composed of me, Martin, Maryiana, Maud, and Zhan/Jan. We collaborated very well through the entire time. </p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <p>We started our work by brainstorming for an idea. We decided to settle for a story type of video, and decided to make it a funny one to attract the viewers, so we started brainstorming.</p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <p>This leads us to our story. A homeless man from Eindhoven is asked about his life pro tip, and he suggests always having a pen. His story begins when he was a young boy and lost his pen in school. He couldn’t take notes, and didn’t know when his exams were coming. Because of that, he couldn’t pass, and with no graduation diploma, he didn’t succeed in getting a job. He tried to exchange his jewelry and other goods for food, but that didn’t last for long. Everyone else around him was making moves in life, starting families, but not him. He was so skinny that he wasn’t only getting rejected, but he also got ill. And this is how he ended up being homeless.</p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <p>We divded tasks evenly. I wrote the scripts, was the director, reviewed the storyboards and editing, and acted as the interviewer.</p><p> Martin had the main role of being a homeless man and helped editing.</p> <p> Mariyana was responsible for the technical arrangements, from camera to microphone. She was my co-director too, and helped Martin edit the footage, after acting as the girl rejecting the man.</p> <p>Zhan acted as the dealer and helped with technical parts, together with Maud. </p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6>
      <p>For processing the video, the software used was Da Vinci Resolve. All the music is non-copyrighted and sourced from Pixabay.</p>

      <h3>The results</h3>
      <p><a href="If you lose your pen.pdf">This</a> is the document containing the explanation of our video assignment, the storyboards, the script and the voiceover script.</p>
      <h6>&nbsp;</h6><p>The video itself can be found as an assignment submission, or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0_NV32sWQI">Youtube.</a></p>

      <h3> Storyboard task </h3>
      <p>We were assigned into teams and tasked to come up with 3 to 4 post-its describing interconnected actions that could be switched between each other and still make sense. I believe we have achieved a good result, as we presented it in front of the class and they were interexchangeable.</p>

      <div class="rectangle-2">
      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <P>I believe this exercise trained us for the actual task of storyboarding, which we would later use for our videography assignment.</P>
      <p>When assembling a (short) movie, we are sometimes required to alter the way in which our scenes are ordered, while maintaining the same plot, for the sake of maintaining the emotional value that the movie brings to the viewer.</p></div>

      <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
      <P>Professional toolset: used Adobe InDesign. <br>

        Visual designs: used layouts to achieve the look and feel of my photobook. <br>
        
        Quality: awaiting more feedback from the teacher. </div>

    <h3> Photo book progress </h3>
    <p>Due to some personal reasons, I couldn't submit my photo book in time, but I started working on its first challenges and its inDesign layout.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rectangle-2">
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <P> I asked for feedback on how the first iteration looks like so far and was told I can add more pages for a singular photo category, that I should make my main photos bigger, align text to just one direction throughout the whole product, and to add the camera specifications for how the photo was made. </P>

    <p> During this week, we were introduced to layouts, the concept and its rules.  </p> <br> 
    <p> To exercise our capability of using layouts correctly by dividing in teams and shaping a two-page part of a magazine on paper, with cutouts of differently colored paper that signified different rules/ categories that had to be included, such as “author 1 picture”, “author 2 picture”, “Ad 1”, “Ad 2”, etc. </p> <br>
    <p> We came up with a back story for our magazine and made it to be a National Geographic kids section about the South and the North pole, written by two brothers. </p> <br> 
    <p> We started with a prototype of how we want our work to look like, as seen on the right. </p>
    <p> The work we did together went very well, with everyone contributing towards our end goal. </p> <br>
     <p>The feedback we got from Josh and our classmates was very positive, with the exception that the pictures should have their main focus further away from the middle of the pages, as that wouldn’t fully show when bending the pages inwards. </p> <br>

          <h3> After receiving feedback on my logo colors and elements looking a little cluttered, I decided to elliminate the orange accents. </h3>

         <p> When creating my logo, I thought about who I am as a person. And according to MBTI 16 personalities, I am an ETNJ, which means I am "a commander: bold, imaginative and strong-willed, always finding a way". </p>
         <p>Besides ICT as a field of work being good for me, other options would be becoming a lawyer or an entrepreneur, which made me want to build a logo with an allure of seriousness, as if I would use it to represent myself in a competitive field of work. You can see a mock-up of a business card on the right.</p>
         <p>I chose pink and orange as my accent colors as they are cheery and lift anyone’s mood up, and because I believe they match my personality and mood while building this website, and also while participating in classes, but also because politically, parties choose these colors to attracts voters and they know he psychology behind that.</p>

        <h3> Iterations</h3>
        <p>To achieve my current logo, I went through a series of iterations where I sketched an initial idea of my logo, tried to render it in Adobe Illustrator multiple times, and changed its color schemes until I found one to match with and dictate my portoflio's website as well. </p>
        <p>The classes we had about colors helped me make my final chcoice, as well as feedback collected from classmates and my family, potential users of my website.</p>

        <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
        <p><em>"You craft quality visual designs with a professional toolset"</em></p>
        <p>I believe I meet the learning outcome criteria as for my logo and other materials for my portfolio I used Adobe Illustrator, and because I have received positive feedback from tteachers, classmates and family on my logo. </p>
