    <p> During this week, we were introduced to layouts, the concept and its rules.  </p> <br> 
    <p> To exercise our capability of using layouts correctly by dividing in teams and shaping a two-page part of a magazine on paper, with cutouts of differently colored paper that signified different rules/ categories that had to be included, such as “author 1 picture”, “author 2 picture”, “Ad 1”, “Ad 2”, etc. </p> <br>
    <p> We came up with a back story for our magazine and made it to be a National Geographic kids section about the South and the North pole, written by two brothers. </p> <br> 
    <p> We started with a prototype of how we want our work to look like, as seen on the right. </p>
    <p> The work we did together went very well, with everyone contributing towards our end goal. </p> <br>
     <p>The feedback we got from Josh and our classmates was very positive, with the exception that the pictures should have their main focus further away from the middle of the pages, as that wouldn’t fully show when bending the pages inwards. </p> <br>

         <p> When creating my logo, I thought about who I am as a person. And according to MBTI 16 personalities, I am an ETNJ, which means I am "a commander: bold, imaginative and strong-willed, always finding a way". </p>
         <p>Besides ICT as a field of work being good for me, other options would be becoming a lawyer or an entrepreneur, which made me want to build a logo with an allure of seriousness, as if I would use it to represent myself in a competitive field of work. You can see a mock-up of a business card on the right.</p>
         <p>I chose pink and orange as my accent colors as they are cheery and lift anyone’s mood up, and because I believe they match my personality and mood while building this website, and also while participating in classes, but also because politically, parties choose these colors to attracts voters and they know he psychology behind that.</p>

        <h3> Iterations</h3>
        <p>To achieve my current logo, I went through a series of iterations where I sketched an initial idea of my logo, tried to render it in Adobe Illustrator multiple times, and changed its color schemes until I found one to match with and dictate my portoflio's website as well. </p>
        <p>The classes we had about colors helped me make my final chcoice, as well as feedback collected from classmates and my family, potential users of my website.</p>

        <h3>Learning outcomes</h3>
        <p><em>"You craft quality visual designs with a professional toolset"</em></p>
        <p>I believe I meet the learning outcome criteria as for my logo and other materials for my portfolio I used Adobe Illustrator, and because I have received positive feedback from tteachers, classmates and family on my logo. </p>
